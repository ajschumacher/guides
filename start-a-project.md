# Start a Project

So you have a project--or an idea for a project--to make life better for the people of DC and you want to bring it to Code for DC? Awesome! We're glad you thought of us. In order to help us help you, here's what you should do:

## Make a Github repo

You may already have one, but make sure that you have a Github repo for the project. This is true even if the project is still just an idea: a repo saves the space, offers some discussion tools, and makes it possible for other people to begin working on the project.

To take the administrative burden off of you, Code for DC can set up a repo for the project in our Github organization. If you want us to do that, just let us know. If you already have a repo, this is still possible: it can be [transferred](https://help.github.com/articles/how-to-transfer-a-repository) into the Code for DC organization without losing any of the commit history or issue.

## Put a `civic.json` file in that repo

A `civic.json` file is the metadata file of the type of civic-oriented project we work on here at Code for DC.

## Let everybody know

Head over to codefordc.org/projects and submit the project's repo URL to us. We'll pull information from Github and that `civic.json` file and make it look nice. Feel free to send a message out to the [listserv](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dc-cfa-brigade), as well, explaining what the project is and what sort of help you think is needed.
